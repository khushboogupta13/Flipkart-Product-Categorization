# Flipkart Product Categorization

This project aims at predicting the category of a product that is usually available on e-commerce sites like Flipkart. The Machine Learning and Deep Learning models have been trained on a Flipkart e-commerce dataset that can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1on6ApK7jNXSy20Bfw_NjKMTmeICTHyBvIK-3am9irFA/edit?usp=sharing).
